Zühlke\nVision\nWe create a collection of articles containing advices we'd like to share with our collegues at Zühlke and with the world of Engineering in general (e.g. potential new colleagues and customers).\nWe write for all engineers at Zühlke and outside of Zühlke - from professional engineers to distinguished consultants - and from future engineers to alumnis.\nThrough our articles, the Zühlke culture manifests itself: they contain practicaly proven concepts, best practices, cultural philosophies and great ideas, they are technically interesting, they motivate you to reflect about the work and they encourage you to share your knowlege and experiences.\nHow to Contribute\n\nAnnounce an article by opening an issue in our backlog\n\nWrite the article\n\nGet it reviewed and published\n\n\nFollow one of our two contribution guidelines to contribute your article:\n\nThe GitHub Contribution Guidelines is the default choice. It ensures a seamless process using Git and GitHub tooling.\n\nThe General Contribution Guideline is for those who are new to GitHub and prefer to work independently from GitHub as much as possible.\n\n\nFor additional questions, we created a page about advanced contribution topics.\nLead Authors\nThe following lead authors are responsible to create, organize, administrate and moderate this project:\n\nChristian Abegg (@abeggchr)\nRolf Bruderer (@bruderol)\nmaybe more later (to be defined)\n\nYou can contact us if you need help to get your contribution into this book.\nLicence\nAll content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0 license.\n"},"github-contribution-guideline.html":{"url":"github-contribution-guideline.html","title":"GitHub Contribution Guidelines","keywords":"","body":"Contribution Guide using Github\nThis guide describes the process and the conventions for contributing an article using the tools provided by GitHub.\nPrerequisites\n\nGet a Github Account if you not yet have one\n\n(optional) Registered as a public member of the \"Zühlke Github Community\" (see advanced contribution topics)\n\n\nAnnounce\n\nCheck for Duplicates: Is there already an article about your topic?\n\nPlease check our Backlog of Articles whether there is already an article existing or planned for similar topic. \n\nIf there is already a similar article, you can contact the author and find a solution (leave the subject to the author, offer your help as reviewer or co-author, take the subject over, or write a second article in response or extension to the first article, ...). \n\n\n\nAnnounce a Topic:\n\nOpen a New Issue for your Article\n\nDescribe roughly the idea you have in mind, what the article should be about.\n\nAssign yourself to the issue.\n\nAssign the label \"article\".\n\nIf you have a great idea about an article, but would not like to write about yourself? Add your idea to the existing Ideas for Articles issue!\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss\nIt proved to be useful to discuss about an articles content before writing the article. Ask your colleagues, maybe they have some valuable input! \n\nUse the Issues on Github: discuss directly in the issue you created - and don't miss to give feedback to other announced articles.\n\nUse Yammer, a coffee break, a team event or similar\n\n\nWrite\nContent Conventions:\n\nwritten in English\n\nshort enough to be read in 10 minutes: size should be less than 2 A4 pages long in printout PDF version (that is between 400 and 750 words)\n\nreflects on a single subject only (better make several articles, if you have too much material / ideas to write about)\n\nmatches our Vision: it is about practicaly proven concepts, best practices, cultural philosophies or great ideas that we use in our daily work at Zühlke.\n\nthe subject is related to our work and the advice concrete enough to consider.\n\nthe subject is something you have experience on in some real projects and not just theoretical ideas\n\n\nLanguage Conventions:\n\napply the rules for capitalization in titles (at least to the \"style guide similarities\" mentioned)\n\nWork directly with GitHub:\nWe are using this Git repository, so contributing an article is as easy as contributing source code in any project. Every article is written in your personal fork of the repository as a simple markdown (*.md) file and reviewed and published by using Pull Requests. \nIf this sounds complicated to you, just carefully follow these very easy steps to create a new article directly on the github web page:\n\nUse this link to fork the Zuehlke/fifty-shades repository.\n\nNavigate to the articles folder in your forked repository. The URL looks something like:\nhttps://github.com/{username}/fifty-shades/tree/develop/articles\n\nEnter a unique name for your article file followed by the *.md file extension. Example: my-funny-article.md (can be changed later)\n\nCopy the content of Article Example as template to start with into the file\n\nAdjust authorName and authorGithubUsername at the top of the file\n\nCommit the new file\n\n\nCongratulations, you have created the article file in your repository! You can now continue to work on your article incrementally directly in GitHub. If you prefer your own text editor: feel free to use your own \"clone-edit-commit-push\"- workflow with your local git client.\nPlease apply the following formal rules:\n\nUse GitHub Flavored Markdown Syntax in the markdown file.\n\nIt is good practice to prefix your commit message with the issue number of your article. Example: #15 add article to Table of Content.\n\n\nPlease note that we are using a public repository - everything you commit can be read by everyone.\nReview\nTo get your article reviewed you have can simply send the URL of your forked repository to a reviewer.\nIf you'd like to use the review features of Github you can directly skip to the next chapter.\nPublish\nTo get your article published you have to go through this review and publishing process:\n\nOpen a pull request with your article to get it reviewed. \nLook out for the \"New Pull Request\" button. The base fork is \"Zuehlke/fifty-shades\" and the head fork is \"{you}/fifty-shades\".\nUse the issue number of your article prefixed with #in the pull request title\n\nFind some colleagues (at least one!) that will review your article and assign him to the pull request.\n\nAs a reviewer you can use GitHubs Review Feature to give feedback\n\nAs an author, after receiving feedback, you modify your content (or ignore the feedback) and commit the modified version into your fork. The Pull Request will automatically be updated. And don't forget to thank your reviewer!\n\nWhen the issue is ready to be published, assign your Pull Request to one of the Lead Authors for final review and publication.\n\nThe assigned lead author will finally merge your pull request, when all the review comments are resolved.\n\nOnce published, you can still correct or improve it, by doing new pull requests from your fork of the repository.\n\nDo not forget to close the issue of your article, once it is published.\n\n\n"},"general-contribution-guideline.html":{"url":"general-contribution-guideline.html","title":"General Contribution Guideline","keywords":"","body":"Contribution Guidelines (general)\nThis guide describes the process and the conventions for contributing an article without relaying too much on GitHub.

Example: The resources file for my-funny-article.md is my-funny-article.resources.md\nInclude the resources at the end of your article using: \n\n{% include \"./my-funny-article.resources.md\" %}\nPlease note: This is a temporary solution. In the future we'd like to auto-detect resources and include them in different ways based on the output. For an electronic format (web, pdf, ebook) the resources are just included. For a printed format (book) the resources might be printed as a QR-Code linking to a website. For more information see https://github.com/Zuehlke/fifty-shades/issues/18\nZühlke Github Community\nTo becoma properly registered as a public member of the \"Zühlke Github Community\":\n\nFollow these instructions: https://github.com/Zuehlke/core/issues/6\nIf you can not access this issue: \nsend your github username to one of the admins, e.g. Rolf Bruderer\nafter you received the invitation, accept it\nthen proceed as described on https://github.com/Zuehlke/core/issues/6\n\n\n\nOppinionated Articles and Controversial Discussions\nIf you find an article in progress too opinionated or controversial, then ...\n\nDo not forget this is an open community and that we should respect all other oppinions and be open for discussion about our ideas with each other in a resspectful kind. This is also what we want to advertise in this book, that we as Zühlke are open for our colleagues ideas and opinions and value each other, even in controversial discussions.\nDo not hesitate to contact the author and discuss with him (e.g. on the issue of the article or for more controversial discussions maybe better face to face or via non-public communication channels)\nDo not forget that the original author was maybe writing the article with another context in mind.\nConsider to plan and write a counter article to pick up the point where you disagree with the original article or add your own view or aspect concerning that topic.\nWe motivate to also write about controversial topics and in some cases it might even make sense to have two articles, one with the arguments pro, another with the arguments contra. See also following example: in the book \"Lessons Learned in Software Testing\" there are two articles, one that recommends using the \"IEEE-829-Standard\" and right on the next page there is the next article that recommends to not use this standard (this was mentioned in https://www.heise.de/developer/artikel/Neuer-Test-Standard-ISO-29119-pro-und-contra-2429610.html).\nIf you can not agree on a topic and there is a conflict that you think needs some help with resolution, you can contact the Lead Authors, they will try to moderate in the conflict situation and help you to decide how to proceed with the article(s) in question.\nAlso relax and bare in mind that not all articles might find place in a printed edition of this collection.\n\n"},"articles/_example.html":{"url":"articles/_example.html","title":"Examples are Essential","keywords":"","body":"Examples are Essential\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.

It highlights the difference between a build system and a build management system, the responsibilities of each and some considerations on the consequences when following the rules.\nIt is layed out as a set of rules to follow when creating build and CI infrastructure for your project. \nThink of each rule as a T.A.R.D.I.S.: they are bigger on the inside. \nThe purpose of this rule set is to guide us toward C.R.I.S.P. (Complete, Repeatable, Informative, Scheduled,Portable) builds1\nDistinctions, distinctions\nTo identify the separate concerns we should provide definitions for the terms: \nA build system performs transformations in sequence according to a predetermined dependency chain to create artifacts. A subset of this is the compilation of sources to binaries.\nA build management system coordinates build system(s).\nSpecificity\nA build system is highly project specific. It is affected by toolchains, project conventions and generally can run only on a specially configured host.\nA build management system can run everywhere as long as it can start the build system on the appropriate host. The specificity of a build management system is limited to the number of version control systems it supports. Although theoretically it doesn't have to provide version control support it is a given that such support will be provided in the minimum feature set.\nThe Makefile is the build system\nMake, rake, Ant, MSBuild, Gradle, grunt etc. are not build systems2. You create build systems with them. \nJenkins, TeamCity, TravisCI, BuildBot etc. are build management systems.\nThe Rules\n1. I am Build Server\nRule #1 requires that the build server follows the exact same steps as any other developer. \nExpressed the other way around: Every developer has to be able to recreate locally the complete build process without deviations given the development environment and the correct version of the source tree.\n2. When the build server says no, it means no!\nRule #2 says that if a build server marks a build as broken, then the build is broken. Drop everything and read the logs. \nThere is no \"it works for me\", your build server is Judge Dredd: judge, juror and executioner.\nYou can only adhere to this rule if you followed Rule #1\n3. IDEs are the enemy A.K.A. F5 is not a build process\nMeans that if you drive your development process from an IDE there is no way you can adhere to the Build Rules. \nThis rule has major complications on the development environment and ties directly into the subject of allowing your developers to use whatever tools they feel comfortable with.\nAdhering to the rules\nTo create a system that adheres to rules #1 & #2 you have to think like a Lego builder: Lots of small, specialized tasks that do one thing and can be used to compose more complex processes.\nAs an example a release task instead of doing everything in one big implementation will depend on the build tasks for each of the libraries and applications and the tasks that run the tests etc. Using the syntax of rake in a contrived example one would do\ntask :release =>[:\"test:all\"]\n\ntask :\"test:all\" => [:\"test:foo\", :\"test:bar\"]\n\ntask :\"test:foo\" => [:\"build:foo\"]\n\nNow a developer will probably use the component tasks a lot more than the composite :release task and we will certainly have a build job on the server that only does releases.\nThis is a necessity since the system needs to satisfy different usage patterns: \n\nThe build server uses composite tasks that implement complete workflows.\nThe developer uses component tasks with surgical precision in the interest of speed and effectiveness.\n\nFrom the perspective of the build system engineer this approach is self-evident for the same reason it is evident when building applications: Small chunks of code are easier to manage, test, reuse and understand.\nConsequences\nThe above rules have widespread consequences in structuring the build and CI processes of a project.\nThe first rule sets the frame within which the build system operates. To adhere to it we avoid using IDE integrations but also build management system integrations (Maven integration in Jenkins being one such example). Handling dependencies, configuring toolchains, even things like naming conventions are left to the build system. The build server becomes just another user, performing exactly the same steps a human developer would use.\nThe first rule combined with the third lead to the prioritization of command line usage. It doesn't mean we do everything just from the command line but that CLI is the first priority when adding features to the tools comprising the development environment. CLI is the one interface both humans and bots can operate with the same facility.\nThe second rule's consequences are a bit more subtle. Avoiding inconsistencies between execution environments is a critical issue and to handle it correctly we need to introduce the concept of a consistent development environment (usually called the 'project VM' as we use virtual machines for encapsulation). The challenge of maintaining and replicating such an environment unavoidably leads to the introduction of a provisioning (A.K.A. configuration management) tool such as Chef, Ansible or Puppet.\nWho does what\nAnother way to look at it is that a build system determines the how and what (build, test, package, deploy, release) while a build management system determines the where and when (which CI node, when to trigger etc.).\nAll of this segues nicely into the final rule:\n4. Your (build) infrastructure is a software development project\nRule #4 means you need tests and CI and a plan. You need to budget for CI, for creating a build system specific to your project, for teaching people how to use it.\nTo make matters worse your users are some of the most obnoxious, impatient and down right pedantic users on the face of the planet. They want everything perfect, robust, simple and fast and they want it yesterday. You better be dogfooding by this point...\n\n1The concept of CRISP builds was first introduced by Mike Clark in his book Pragmatic Project Automation\n2 We can debate on CMake and Maven\n"},"articles/meet-users.html":{"url":"articles/meet-users.html","title":"Meet With Users - Often","keywords":"","body":"Meet With Users - Often\nMeeting with users, the more the better, is essential to create great products.\nEven though – as a UX professional – I must stress the importance of meeting users, I have to admit that the title of this article is not exactly accurate and just meeting users is not really the point. Having revealed this, I should probably explain what really matters when meeting users and give some indication on how to do it. \nWhat Really Matters\nChallenge #1: We who develop a technical system are not like the users.\nThis has two notable reasons: (1) The more we are involved in the development the more elaborate is our mental model about the system and how the system is meant to be used. Someone with no involvment has a completely different model and will want to do different things. (2) Even when we are users, we are just some of them. There usually are many more users with quite different needs and mental models.\nIt follows that, as developers of a system, we identify needs that do not represent those of the whole user base and derive functions users will not really use and set inadequate priorities and create user interfaces that do not match the users tasks and expectations. \nConclusion #1: the more we rely on our evaluation of the product we are creating, the more likely the product is going to suck\nThings are even more interesting. What users really need changes constantly. And it is most vexing for some of us (for others it is a fantastic opportunity) that we who create technical systems drive change. Introducing new possibilities changes what people are doing, how they are doing it, what they trying to achieve and thus what they expect from the technology we provide. \nChallenge #2: a new product changes what people need from a product.\nThe better we can anticipate the change, the better our products will meet the future needs. And to anticipate a change we have one option: we must create the solution, either as a mock, an MvP or even as a product and we must let users use them as realistically as possible. From this we can learn what the future could behold. By the way, people can get quite creative and do stuff nobody every thought of doing with our products. If we can harness this creative power our products will rock the market. The key is to be one step ahead of the customers. So while they adapt to the new technology, you observe them, learn about their life, create new ideas and start the next cycle.\nWhat really matters: create products quickly and let users use them so you can learn what will be important for your customers\nA Bit of Theory on How To Do It\nAs theoretical background, I need to combine two elements on one time line: \n\nThe UCD (User Centred Design) cycle is probably self explanatory. It is the basic iteration principle and tells you to get to know context and users, create solutions, evaluate the solution against context and users, and learn from it. You do this cycle over and over again.\nTwo of the three layers are probalby quite easy to understand as well. While you create the product, you will work on the concept and work-out all the details so using the product really becomes a great experience. The story is the product in a nutshell and tells what impact the product should create for whom and how. It is sometimes referred to as product vision. \nThe interesting part is how you evolve a product from idea to retirement. Theory proposes to run quick UCD cycles all along. The cycles just change purpose and the character along the way. \nEarly on, you focus the cycles on getting a promising story. You do research and create simple \"prototypes\" of the story. While the story gets more and more stable some big questions will need answering and the UCD cycle is about testing hypothesis. You create sketchy prototypes or \"experience sketches\" with a narrow focus so you can make the important conceptual decisions. Early adopters asking when the product is ready are a good sign to change the character again: Now its about scoping the first release and getting the concept right. To do this you will work out some key scenarios in detail, explore more alternatives of the basic design and test these thoroughly. Such activities flow more on more into working and optimizing the details with user experience testing so your first release is going to be just great. \nOnce the release is on the market things get complicated as you need to juggle three streams: The first stream to optimize the details based on real life feedback, the second stream to enhance the product with other features and the third stream to identify completely new ideas to launch the next big product.  \nFrom the Trenches\nGet inspired by life\nUsually, meeting with users starts with life as of today. Go an observe people, talk with them about what they are doing, why, what they love and what they hate. You can also become an apprentice and do it yourself, instructed by a master. Identify their tasks, their values and beliefs, what they try to achieve and what hinders them. The goal: Gain understanding of users and their context, identfy and test possible stories. \nMethods that help here for meeting with users:\n\nContextual inquiry & design, observations\nUX questionnaires and benchmarks\nEmpathy maps and response cards\nStorytelling, storyboarding \nMock-ups and lo-fi prototyping.\n\nThings to be aware of\n\nYou will learn a lot already from the first session. Avoid doing all the sessions first and then analysing them. Rather steer your progress with a list of open questions, analyse each session immediately and rework your open questions.\nParticipants will give you many solutions. Listen and learn what they really wanted to achieve and come up with even better solutions.\nAvoid ticking off questions from a prepared questionnaire.\nYou need a wide range of opinions so pick a wide variety of participants. \nThe gist of the problem lies in the daily hassles. Thus go and do or talk about real work and real examples. Avoid talking about generalisations. Collect concreate real life stories to drive product development.\nCapture the details as direct quote, collect pictures, materials, forms people are using. These material will later allow you to quickly create prototypes that can handle real life problems. \nYou need to consolidate your learnings over several participants: a big wall and sticky notes do the trick.\nBe sensitive to commonalities and differences between the different persons you talked to and work them out. There is no average user.\n\nAs a result of such acitivities you can expect to have much deeper knowledge about users, their life, their work and their dreams as well as loads of ideas on how to achieve a dream or two. \nEvolve the product story\nA product story touches at least some of the very fundamental questions of the product definition. I.e. the problem (for whom, what situations, what impact), the solution (what product and what it replaces), the market (size, revenue-cost-structure, players) and the plan (main features, architecture, migration strategy, team, time and money needed).\nJust filling out a lean canvas or creating a storyboard is not enough to evolve the product story. When we do this we must probe the users and get some more substantial evidence. Is the problem relevant? Does the solution fit? \nThere are a bunch of more or less complete method frameworks like design thinking, design sprint, user experience sketching, contextual design, lean startup and more. Whatever the name, in the essence, they tell to build a team that iteratively creates and evaluates solutions with users/customers, learn from the feedback about problem, solution and product story.\nA few methods to use here for meeting users:\n\nUX sketches, physical mock-ups and paper prototypes\nNarratives, storyboards\nMvPs and test implementations.\nHallway testing, UX walkthroughs\nWizard of Oz testing\nUX questionnaires, metrics and benchmarks\nEmpathy maps, Response cards\n\nThere are also techniques to co-create solutions together with selected users, making the feedback loop even faster. In a typical participatory session the team chooses one aspect of the solution to discuss with users, creates simple building blocks and lets a group of users work with them. While users discuss how to best solve the aspect, the team listens and observes and gains understanding about the different needs and possible solutions. The team can obviously also propose solutions and by that bring their creativity and design expertise into the workshop. Look for these keywords to find more: Participatory design, co-creation, make space.\nThis needs an example: To equip a police car, designers created card board models of the equipment to go into the car. They then took and old police car in a police station, their card board models and then asked a couple of police officers to place the equipment so it would really be best. By doing this, they learned a lot about placement options, constraints, real world issues and moments of police life.\nThings to be aware of\n\nBusiness analysts, market researcher, UX professionals all talk to the users and collect information but with a different focus. They  reach different conclusions and if they do not align well, there will be trouble.\nReally get creative with how you create prototypes and test them. Prototypes should allow to experience the future life with the product and they should be quick and cheap to build. Usually it's a good idea to fake most of the interactive stuff by a person who plays the \"computer\". \nTry different variants, your first idea will not be the right.\nEvaluate the solution against relevant problems. Avoid letting users explore a prototype on their own or by artificial tasks. Invest into creating realistic tasks and scenarios. Ideally, users bring their own work and try to do this with your prototype.\n\nWhile doing this, you can expect that the story gets sharper. You also learn a lot about users, their lives, their work and their dreams and many ideas on the products concept\nNail the concept\nOnce you really start developing the product, you will want to set a few fundamental cornerstones of the solution: information architecture, navigation, layouts and responsive stuff, key elements of the visual design, globalisation approaches, error handling approaches and more. And you want to test this with users.\nMethods for meeting with users that help are \n\nScenarios, Visual Scenarios\nWireframes, Lofi Prototyping\nUser/Usability Walkthroughs, Hallway Testing\nUX Questionnaires and Benchmarks\nEmpathy Maps, Response Cards\nParticipatory Design Workshops, Card Sorting\n\nThings to be aware of:\n\nYou cannot create a product concept without going into the details of the design. Take a few interesting key examples (key path scenarios) to design for and create the concept based on them. Use additional scenarios to verify.\nIf getting to users is cumbersome (it usually is), try the hallway to get a quick first feedback. Just put your drafty sketches on the wall, grab anyone available over the hall and let them give you feedback.\nThe first solution is usually not the best solution. So try different approaches. Involve others to point you to new approaches. Try the hallway first to do this.\nAgain, realistic tasks or even tasks people brought with them is what you want to evaluate against. \n\nFrom these activities you can expect to find the architecture of the user interface of your product. You also will learn a lot about users, about your story and you will define many details of the product.\nWork out the details and fine-tune your solution\nWhenever you need to implement a user story, you will also need to work-out the details on what exactly to do and how this piece fits in the overall product developed so far. So while you are tackling a story you also define the detailed interactions and visuals. Also in this step, user input is welcome. Therefore again some methods that help meeting with users: \n\nHifi prototyping, Lofi prototyping\nHallway Testing, User/Usability Walkthrough\nUsability Testing & Usability Lab\nBusiness Walkthroughs, Pilot Installations\nLife A/B Testing\nUX Questionnaires and Benchmarks\nEmpathy Maps, Response Cards\n\nThings to be aware of:\n\nWhen working out the details of the story start anew with the real needs and try to find the simple solution. Avoid implementing wireframes a UX professional created alone in his cubicle or a requirments a BA wrote after listening to a stakeholder. Work as a team and dig into the user story: what does the user want to achieve in this story and what is the best compromise to do so and what should you therefore build.\nDon't forget to get some feedback. Wireframes, quick interactive prototype are useful here.\nFine-tuning the product because of a story will also need changing stuff that is already done and ready. Be warend: this needs room the PO did not provide!\nOnce you've implemented a bigger story, let users do their work with the story. Provide a test system or even release it so you can measure and get feedback.\nSetup a simple usability lab if you need to optimize specific aspects. Here users can work undisturbed and video recordings allow you to analyse the details of the interaction.\nNot every function has the same importance or difficulty. Test and optimize only what really needs to be optimized.\nDon't let users be the first to test. Take a real life story and play it through. You will find many quirks in your product.\n\nWho should meet with users?\nVery simple answer: the team. Not the BA, not the RE, not the PO, not the UX person. You cannot delegate the responsibility for \"Great Product\" to one person. If the team does not have a sound common understanding of what really is important for users those with little understanding will introduce small glitches and big blunders that need additional work. \nPractice needs some compromises and UX skills are excellent assets in a team. But even if UX persons have the most exposure to users, do not let them have the sole contact. Always include other members of the team.\nIf you don't care about the quality of your product, let a BA talk to users and let the BA hand the results over to an RE to write requirements who passes this document over to a UX person for some wireframes that will be coloured by a visual designer and then implemented by the UI developer while the architecture team provides the framework and the database gurus provide the tables. This is a sure way to product failure.\nOptions on how to get to users\nGetting to users can be quite difficult, even though it's necessairy. Here a few ideas (including how not too meet user and still call it user-centric):\n\nSimulate users, i.e. do it yourself and put a user's shoes on. Ok, not really users but at least you try to look through users glasses. Good enough for quick and dirty checking whether you actually support the whole process.\nReplace users with anybody over the hallway (hallway testing). Still not really users but at least people who are not expert on the system and will point out issues you have become blind to.\nReplace users by people who know the users: Trainers, retailers, support, service engineers and similar. Even though they are not users, they may have good insights about users. \nDo informal meetings and use your network to reach users. Easy way of getting access to users for a short session. Obviously needs a network.\nHitch-hike on field trips somebody else is doing (e.g. a service engineer, sales people) and use these opportunities to meet with users.\nGo to a place you are likely to find users and motivate people to talk to you. Works for short sessions. \nGo up the hierarchy to request users for session. Works for longer sessions and workshops. However needs time and you must convince the bosses to give you access. This can be quite tough for B2B situations where users are shielded by the customer, the local distributor and the global marketing. \nRequest users into your team for maybe 30 to 50% of their time. Make sure that these users are still doing their job otherwise they quickly unlearn to be users. Prefer competent and expert users over novices.\nEstablish a user pool you can draw upon for session. Be aware that these users are usually locals and do not represent the whole world. Also you will have a bias to users willing to participate in such a pool. \nUse recruiting companies to organize \"users\" from their pool. Needs a precise profile of whom you are looking for and has a bias towards people that are likely to participate in a pool. \nOpen up your development to general public and let users join the discussion about what they need, give you feedback etc. using discussion boards, trello, jira, mural, slack, yammer or whatever tools you can provide. This has a bias towards people that are more active and want to get involved. You can use such a platform to let users discuss and synchronize their needs. Easier to setup if you have a product.\nCreate an MvP and gather feedback from your users. Excellent because you can get numbers with some relevance.\nInstall your development team right next to your users so you can just walk over and talk to them. There is no better way. Sadly it is not feasible most of the time.\n\nNeed a final word?\nHere it is, adapted from google: Focus the team on meeting with users and everything else follows.\n"},"articles/time-management.html":{"url":"articles/time-management.html","title":"Start Using a Time Management Technique Today","keywords":"","body":"Start Using a Time Management Technique Today\nSo you take a task from the board, work on it from A to Z and on nothing else. Sounds familiar? I mainly know this situation theoretically. In real life there is always some interruption like a review to be conducted, a bug to be analysed or a phone call to be answered. And having the smartphone laying around vibrating with the latest funny pictures on WhatsApp doesn't help either. Even though we use a prioritized list of work items in our teams, my work as a developer is far away from being focussed on a single task. \nUnlike people who perform at their best when being a \"firefighter\", I do not like this mode of work. But what can you do about it? Most teams use a regular meeting to improve the way how the team works together. Some things can be achieved here, but on a personal level, you will still have to find a way to set the focus on and to deal with interuptions. This is where personal time management techniques step in.\nThere are a lot of techniques available - I recommend to have a look at the following three:\nGetting Things Done\nGettings Things Done provides a comprehensive way of sorting all incoming stuff into various buckets like a waiting list, a calendar, an archive or even the trash. I never felt that I had so much stuff to organise so I never applied the technique. Reading through the documentation gives you some good hints how to challenge incoming stuff though:\n\nIs the stuff actionable at all? If not, get rid of it.\nWhat is the concrete next action?\nCan it be done in two minutes? If yes, do it right away.\n\nPersonal Kanban\nPersonal Kanban is an adoption of the Kanban method for your personal use. You basically visualize all your work on the board, limit the work in progress and focus on the taks you have chosen. I really like having a Personal Kanban board in our kitchen at home, although it is more of a family Kanban there.\nPomodoro Technique\nThe Pomodoro Technique is, as you can guess, my favourite. It takes a \"pomodoro\" as unit of work. Pomodoro is Italian for tomato and the techniques name is inspired by these tomato-shaped kitchen timers. \nThe technique consists - among other things - of five steps:\n\nPlan your work: What will you do today? What is your focus during the next pomodoro?\nStart the pomodoro, for example by setting a kitchen timer to 25 minutes.\nWork on a single task you planned until the pomodoro (25 minutes) is over.\nMark a uninterupted pomodoro with an X.\nTake a break (5min after every pomodoro and 20min after 4 pomodoros).\n\nThe Pomodoro Technique supports you brain to be as efficient as possible:\n\nBy marking a pomodoro as done you get a reward for your work. Every 25 minutes!\nHaving a break every now and then allows your brain to take a step back and probably come up with new ideas.\nAdditionally a break helps you get out of a flow where you probably no longer see the whole picture.\nHaving a rythm frees your brain from the need to structure your time.\nBy handling interuptions actively you gain more capacity to focus on your work.\nWith the mindset of \"having some time at your disposal\" instead of \"having to fight against the time\" you have a positive attitude towards time.\n\nThe first thing I noticed after applying the Pomodoro Technique was, that I was more relaxed after work. Only on a second sight I also noticed that I was more focused during the work. This is mainly through the changed way I handle interuptions with this technique. Internal interuptions like other tasks coming to my mind during work are just written to the work log - and it can be forgotten again. External interuptions like phone calls, emails or collegues walking to your desk need a different approach. The easy part is all electronic stuff: switch off Outlook notifications, put your chat to \"not available\" and turn smartphone to silent mode - et voilà, you will not be interupted by these means during your pomodoro. But do not forget to check email and phone in the next break! Working with collegues is more difficult: I think collaboration is so important, that I generally do not consider a collegue walking to to my desk to be an interuption. But in times when I really want to focus on my pomodoro, rescheduling the conversation usually works fine. I just say: \"I'll be with you in 10 minutes\", make a note and then keep my promise.\nIt doesn't matter whether you choose an existing personal time management technique, combine aspects of them or come up with something completely different yourself. I just think it is important that you find a way how to stay focussed.\nLinks\nAbout the Technique\n\nOnline: The Pomodoro Technique by Francesco Cirillo.\nThe Pomodoro Technique: Francesco Cirillo, 2013, FC Garage, 978-3981567908.\nThe Pomodoro Technique Illustrated: Staffan Nöteberg, 2009, Pragmatic Programmers, 978-1-93435-650-0.\n\nRecommended Tools\n\nPen and paper, the best for planning, working and analysis.\nFocusBooster for web and desktop, includes reporting.\nTimeWise timer for Android (unfortunately not available in Germany).\nClearFocus timer for Android.
