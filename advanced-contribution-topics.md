# Oppinionated Articles and Controversial Discussions

If you find an article in progress too opinionated or controversial, then ...

* Do not forget this is an open community and that we should respect all other oppinions and be open for discussion about our ideas with each other in a resspectful kind. This is also what we want to advertise in this book, that we as ZÃ¼hlke are open for our colleagues ideas and opinions and value each other, even in controversial discussions.
* Do not hesitate to contact the author and discuss with him (e.g. on the issue of the article or for more controversial discussions maybe better face to face or via non-public communication channels)
* Do not forget that the original author was maybe writing the article with another context in mind.
* Consider to plan and write a counter article to pick up the point where you disagree with the original article or add your own view or aspect concerning that topic.
* We motivate to also write about controversial topics and in some cases it might even make sense to have two articles, one with the arguments pro, another with the arguments contra. See also following example: in the book "Lessons Learned in Software Testing" there are two articles, one that recommends using the "IEEE-829-Standard" and right on the next page there is the next article that recommends to not use this standard (this was mentioned in https://www.heise.de/developer/artikel/Neuer-Test-Standard-ISO-29119-pro-und-contra-2429610.html).
* If you can not agree on a topic and there is a conflict that you think needs some help with resolution, you can contact the [Lead Authors](#lead-authors), they will try to moderate in the conflict situation and help you to decide how to proceed with the article(s) in question.
* Also relax and bare in mind that not all articles might find place in a printed edition of this collection.
