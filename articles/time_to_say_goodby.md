Setting up a project in an efficient way is not an easy task: To share the vision of the project, to ensure that all are aligned and have a common understanding of how the project will be managed. It is nowadays a good practice to have a kick off workshops, not only 1h but one day with with teambuilding and vision sharpening, not only once but depending on the project duration in regular intervals. 

But how does it look like at the end of the project? Is everyone aware of how long he will be involved in the project? What are the tasks when the project is coming to an end? When will be the last working day? What will happen with the project deliveries after project closing? Who is going to ensure operations starting when and how?

The following can often be observed:

* Ops and Support were involved too late or not in an efficient way due to time constrains or other reasons. Therefore, they are not enabled to take over tasks and responsibility.
* Transfer to operation is not proceeding because the project team is still receiving all new requests and tries to handle these. 
* People are happy to be contacted and needed, because there might be a certain kind of uncertainty in terms of how things are going and how much longer we will be involved in the project. Every change brings a certain kind of unsecureness.
* Most often knowledge transfer and handover does not take place, but resentment due to unclear responsibilities takes over.
* Sometimes the project manager simply says there is no more work and there is no information flow any longer. Project members feel dropped, not appreciated and some kind of frustration sinks in. 
* By the way, something similar might happen when project members are assigned to a new project and expectations are not aligned between project members, former and new project managers.
* And last but not least a completely different aspect: people are getting frustrated because of all the learnings they did within the project, realizing, that in the end the new project is making exactly the same mistakes right at the beginning.
 
Based on these insights I would like to give you 6 suggestions of what can be done to reduce or avoid the previously mentioned situations.
 
1. Involve operations and support as soon as possible
Here I do not mean just invite them to the team meeting, but also ask them what their expectations to the project are and what they need in order to take over responsibility at the end of the project. Ask them for document reviews and involve them as tester. Create an informal documentation of all issues and decisions taken as further reference and handbook. 
 
2. Give the transition phase a name, define, plan and communicate this phase
Just like the development must be planned beforehand also the transition needs to be planned in advance. Official communication that this phase will now start and what will be the achievements of this phase will help all involved people and give some kind of orientation.
 
3. Redefine roles, responsibilities and meetings in the team and communicate the result
With the new phase and activities, responsibilities will change. Maybe a business analyst will no longer be responsible for requirements only but also for training and support of the support team or a test manager will no longer be needed. Some tasks shall be done by operations now and no longer by the project team itself. Therefore, a new definition of roles and responsibilities in the team is crucial as well as communication of the new assignments. Team meetings or defect meetings may no longer be required. Therefore, meetings to discuss existing production issues, progress within trainings or performance and usage statistics are more relevant. From my perspective it is better to stop old meeting series and setup new meetings with new agenda and participants instead of reusing old ones to have an official shift.
 
4. Look for contact with the team member and their superior
Sometimes team members will be lured to directly change to another project. Sometimes this is not the case. Anyway, as a project manager I recommend to discuss with the superiors by when the team member is leaving the current project and to which share the person will work in the new project or can take over new tasks outside the current project. This agreement should be taken between superior, project manager(s) and team member in order that all have the same view of the situation.
 
5. No project without any learnings
Invite right beforehand all team members to a lessons learned meeting. Ensure that the meeting will either be split in separate ones if there are too many people involved for a common retro or search for someone to support you doing the lessons learned workshop. The workshop may be organized as a “world café”. Good practice is to make the project stages visible by putting cards on the wall for each month and each event during the project duration, make collages or write a story / poem. As a source of information, you can use the monthly status reports or your project diary. You will be amazed of what happened (and you already forgot about it) and what you and the team achieved. One important point for me is, that at the end of the meeting every single participant has the possibility to write his own lessons learned and take these notes with him into the next project. Maybe you can prepare some cards beforehand and hand them out as template that they can fill out. You can also ask your team members either for feedback to your job or if they want you to provide them feedback about themselves. To be prepared for these activities it is helpful to start writing a project diary and note some keywords each week what happened, what was good, what was bad, what are my learnings and also with your private project diary what happened to all team members so that you can see their development through the time being.

 6. “Goodbye and thank you for the fish”
Most often project manager forget to take some budget in account for celebration of the project success or have a small give away as “Thank you” to the project members. No matter if you have any budget or not, it is a good habit to invite your team members in advance to a project closing meeting. Purpose of this meeting is to officially hand over all responsibilities to the operations team and relieve the project team. That is also a good possibility to reflect the past months and perform a project review. Summarize the findings from your lessons learned meeting and share the impressions of that. This is the moment to say thank you. Maybe by some personal words to each member, a card with some keywords what was special to the person during the project duration, photos, etc... There are many possibilities to show recognition without expensive gifts or events.
 
As a conclusion in my opinion a successful project closure must be prepared already at the beginning of the development phase. Documents should be updated with each sprint or iteration and each learning and insight should be documented in a way that this can be handed over to support and operation to enable them to solve issues by themselves. Also some kind of project diary for the whole project might help at the end of the project to remember what happened, what has been done to solve issues and if these measurements were successful. As the project has a planning phase at the beginning, so does it have a transition phase when it is coming to an end. Here I dare to make the statement that transparency gives security. Talk about what’s going on, what are the plans and involve all team members and stakeholders as you have (hopefully) done at the beginning of the project.
