# Use a time management technique already

So you took a task from the board, work on it from A to Z and on nothing else. Sounds familiar? I mainly know this situation from my dreams. In my experience there is always a review to be conducted, a bug to be analysed or a phone call to be answered. 

and having your smartphone laying at the table vibrating with the latest funny pictures on WhatsUp doesn't help either.

What should I work on?

I often see collegues struggeling on what they should work on. On one side there is the planned task they took over, on the other side there is a bug to be solved in something 

Even though we use a prioritized list of work items in our teams, my work as a developer was far away from being focussed on a single task. 


Unlike people who perform at their best when being in a "firefighter mode", I do not like this mode of work. But what can you do about it? Most team use a regular meeting to improve the way how the team works together. Some things can be achieved here, but on a personal level, you will still have to find what to focus on and deal with interuptions. This is where personal time management techniques step in.

There are a lot techniques available - for our daily work I recommend to have a look at the following:
* Getting Things Done (GTD)
* Personal Kanban
* Pomodoro Technique

Getting Things Done
? 
It's kind of complicated.

Personal Kanban is an adoption of the Kanban method for your personal use. You basically visualize all your work on the board, limit the work in progress and focus on the taks you have chosen. I never succeeded in applying Personal Kanban at the workplace but I really like having a Personal Kanban board in our kitchen at home, although it is more of a Family Kanban there.

My favourite in the Pomodoro Technique.

  Short introduction to pomodoro technique
* 25min / 5min
* plan
* internal / external interuption
switch of Outlook notification
turn smartphone to silent mode

* another take on the time
  
First, I noticed that through the structure, rythm I was more relaxed after work.

Only on a second sight I also noticed, that I work more focused.

Overload -> ability to finish and focus decreases

Takeaways (breaks, focus, free your mind, handle interuptions)

Dont' see the time as black and white / different qualities in time.


visualize / write down

    Feedback from Discussion:
  
    
I don't know whether this is related: apart from managing what to do in what order I think there are also different types of quality that a certain time slice in a day can have. There's

    daily standup time
    not so interesting but somehow important meeting time
    coffee break time
    brainstorming something before the whiteboard with somebody else time
    trying to get things done but being constantly interrupted by others time
    isolating myself from the rest of the team to actually get focus time to get things done time
    etc.

Each of these time types has different advantages and disadvantages to myself and to the team. So I need to have a good mix of them in order to maximize overall productivity. I guess this is also covered in some of the techniques, but I don't really know because I have not studied any of them. So I'm looking forward to the article.
